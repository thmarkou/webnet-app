# App Export Guide

## Current Status

The app has been successfully exported for development, but we encountered C++ compilation issues with the `react-native-worklets` library during the Android build process.

## What We've Accomplished

✅ **Expo Export Successful**: The app has been exported to the `dist/` folder
✅ **All Dependencies Resolved**: All React Native dependencies are properly installed
✅ **App Configuration Ready**: `app.json` is properly configured for Android
✅ **Subscription System**: Deactivated for development, ready for production

## Current Issues

❌ **Native Compilation Errors**: C++ compilation issues with `react-native-worklets` library
❌ **Android Build Failing**: Gradle build fails due to native library conflicts

## Solutions

### Option 1: Remove Problematic Dependencies (Recommended for Quick Export)

```bash
# Remove the problematic worklets dependencies
npm uninstall react-native-worklets react-native-worklets-core

# Clean and rebuild
npx expo install --fix
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
npx expo run:android
```

### Option 2: Use EAS Build (Recommended for Production)

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure EAS project
eas build:configure

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### Option 3: Use Expo Development Build

```bash
# Create development build
npx expo install expo-dev-client
npx expo run:android --variant debug
```

### Option 4: Manual APK Creation

1. **Remove problematic dependencies** from `package.json`
2. **Clean the project**: `npx expo install --fix`
3. **Build Android**: `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`
4. **Find APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Files Ready for Distribution

### Exported Files (in `dist/` folder)

- ✅ **JavaScript Bundle**: `_expo/static/js/android/index-*.hbc`
- ✅ **Assets**: All app assets properly bundled
- ✅ **Metadata**: `metadata.json` with app configuration

### App Configuration

- ✅ **Package Name**: `com.fmarkou.webnetapp`
- ✅ **Version**: `1.0.0`
- ✅ **Icons**: App icons properly configured
- ✅ **Splash Screen**: Configured and ready

## Next Steps

### For Development Testing

1. **Use Expo Go**: Install Expo Go app and scan QR code
2. **Development Build**: Create development build without problematic dependencies
3. **Web Version**: Test on web using `npx expo start --web`

### For Production Release

1. **Fix Native Dependencies**: Resolve worklets compilation issues
2. **Use EAS Build**: Cloud build service handles native compilation
3. **Manual Build**: Remove problematic dependencies and build locally

## App Features Ready

✅ **Authentication System**: Login, registration, demo accounts
✅ **Professional Search**: Find professionals with filters and friend recommendations
✅ **Appointment Booking**: Book appointments with professionals
✅ **Social Features**: Friends, chat, notifications
✅ **Admin Panel**: Database management, user management
✅ **Subscription System**: Ready for production (currently disabled)
✅ **Greek Localization**: All text in Greek
✅ **Modern UI**: Professional design with Tailwind CSS

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Testing

- Use **Expo Go** for development testing
- Test on **web version** for full functionality
- Use **development build** without worklets

### For Production Release

- **Fix worklets compilation** or remove dependency
- **Use EAS Build** for cloud compilation
- **Test on real devices** before release
- **Enable subscription system** for production
